There was once a rich man, Joseph  whose wife, Sarah lay sick, and when she felt her end drawing near she called to her only daughter, Cinderella to come near her bed, and said, "Dear child, be pious and good, and God will always take care of you, and I will look down upon you from heaven, and will be with you." And then she closed her eyes and expired. The maiden went every day to her mother's grave and wept, and was always pious and good. When the winter came the snow covered the grave with a white covering, and when the sun came in the early spring and melted it away, Joseph married to another new wife, Edith. Her two daughters, Grizella and Drizella came along with her. They became Step-mother and Step.Sisters for Cinderella.
They were very ugly. She got up every morning at six o'clock, then she made breakfast for her sisters, and afterwards she cleaned the house. She worked all day. Her two ugly sisters were very lazy; they never did any work because Cinderella did everything. Cinderella was very unhappy.
The country was ruled by The King Charles and he has a son Prince Henry who is searching for a true love. One day, the postman came to the house. He gave Cinderella's sister, Grizella an envelope. In the envelope there were three invitations to a party at the Prince Henry's house. She said to her sisters, "Fantastic! There is a party at the Prince's house. I can wear my new red dress and Drizella can wear her new blue dress, but Cinderella can't go because her dress is old and dirty and she hasn't got any shoes."
