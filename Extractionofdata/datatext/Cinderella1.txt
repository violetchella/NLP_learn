On Saturday at 8 o'clock, the ugly sisters went to the party. Cinderella sat in the kitchen. She was very sad. There was a ring at the door. Cinderella opened the door. There was a woman. She said, "Hello! I am your Fairy Godmother. Why are you sad?" Cinderella said, "I want to go to the party but I haven't got any beautiful clothes." The Fairy Godmother said, "No problem, here is a new dress and some glass shoes. There is a golden bicycle in the street. Now you can go to the party, but you must return before 12 o'clock." Cinderella said, "Thank you." She put on the glass shoes and the red dress. She looked very pretty. Then she went to the party by bicycle.
The party was very good. At first, Cinderella was very shy but after an hour, Prince Henry asked Cinderella to dance. They danced for a long time. Prince Henry said to Cinderella, "I like your dress and you are very pretty." Cinderella was very happy. She forgot what time it was. Suddenly the clock rang. Cinderella said, "Oh no! I must go. It is 12 o'clock." She ran home and at the door of the Prince Henry's house, she lost her shoe.
The next day, Prince Henry was very sad because he was in love with Cinderella but he didn't know where she lived. He went to all the houses in the village and said, "Do you know whose shoe this is?" Finally, he went to Cinderella's house. Cinderella opened the door. Prince Henry said, "I love you. Do you want to marry me?" Cinderella said, "Yes." The wedding was the week after. Cinderella and Prince Henry were never unhappy again. They had two Children, Sam and Jeni.
